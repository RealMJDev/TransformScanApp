# TransformScanApp
This is the app I am trying to build for Transform electrical wholesalers.

(1) In The SCAN PAGE - I want the camera to open in the camera container and search for barcodes.(Or user can type code manually)
    Then the user needs to select a quantity for that product code that was scanned or typed in.
    THEN -- when the 'check' button is clicked, it should take the product code and quantity and display it in the LIST PAGE.
    
(2) In the LIST PAGE - I want a list to be created dynamically as the user types in a new code and quantity in SCAN PAGE and adds it.
    I want a quantity input, a text input and a delete button to be created in the same row...
    If the user goes back to SCAN PAGE and types a new code and quantity, a new line gets generated in LIST PAGE under the other one.
    
(3) In the PRICE PAGE - I want to user to be able to search either the code or the description in the search bar.
    I want the results to display in a dropdown list as the user is busy typing...
    If the user clicks on any result from the dropdown list, 
    The Product Code, Product Description and Product Price gets displayd..each in its own div.
